	<li><span>A White Rabbit</span>
		<div>
			<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>
			<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><span>Popped Down A Rabbit-Hole</span>
		<div>
			<p>There was nothing so <i>VERY</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <i>VERY</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <b>TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET</b>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before see a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li><span>Alice Went After It</span>
		<div>
			<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. </p>
			<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
</ul>
